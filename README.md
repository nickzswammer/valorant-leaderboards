# Valorant Leaderboard Website

<b>Warning! Riot is very lazy and does not provide anyone with a permanent API key. The response may not be working since updates to the API key which regenerates every 24 hours must be manually updated. Please use the contact form to notify me if the API key is expired.</b>

It will not be maintained 24/7 so expect the website to not work. In the case of this happening please use the contact form to inform me and I will update the API key.


This website provides an accurate and up-to-date Valorant ranked leaderboard based on Riot's Developer API.
